### 4️⃣ Practice Pitch (30 mins)
**When they ask: "Tell me about a project"**

> "I built an end-to-end ML system to predict Titanic survival. Through EDA, I discovered females had 74% survival versus 19% for males, and passenger class significantly impacted outcomes. I engineered features like family_size, compared 4 algorithms, and achieved 82% accuracy with Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning. The deliverable is a production-ready Scikit-Learn pipeline that handles preprocessing and predictions seamlessly."

**Time**: 30 seconds  
**Impact**: Shows technical depth + communication skills
