## 🎤 Interview Usage

### **When They Ask**: "Tell me about a project you're proud of"

**Answer Template**:
> "I built an end-to-end machine learning system to predict Titanic passenger survival. I started by defining clear success criteria - achieve over 80% accuracy and create a production-ready pipeline. 
>
> Through comprehensive EDA, I discovered key patterns: females had 74% survival rate versus 19% for males, and first-class passengers survived at 63% versus 24% for third-class.
>
> I engineered features like family_size and is_alone based on domain knowledge, which improved performance by 4%. After comparing 4 algorithms, I chose Random Forest and tuned it using GridSearchCV, achieving 82% accuracy.
>
> The final deliverable was a complete Scikit-Learn pipeline that handles preprocessing and predictions, saved with joblib for easy deployment. This demonstrates my ability to build production-ready ML systems, not just train models."

**Key Metrics to Mention**:
- 82% accuracy (exceeds target)
- 4% improvement from feature engineering
- 4 algorithms compared
